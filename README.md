# Factorial calculator
Write a program that computes the factorial of a given number.

* Accept an input number from the user
* Feed that number into the factorial function as an argument
* Return the factorial

## Example
```
Input number? 5
Returned value: 120

Input number? 3
Returned nmber: 6
```

## Suggested Approach
1) Gather user input in "main"
2) Your factorial function should have a parameter that represents the base number
3) Loops are your friends!
4) Be sure to return your result

## Hints
* Use the section under `if __name__ == '__main__': ` to change arguments and check your work.
* When you are happy with your code, use `input()` to prompt the user for a value.
* Add code to [my_code.py](./my_code.py) to make it do the desired thing.
* Run your code with: `python my_code.py` or the run button
* Run your tests with: `pytest`
